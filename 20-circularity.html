	<p>Consider your brief or project aims. How could you leverage a new business model (existing or potential) to increase the circularity of your design?</p>

	<p>How could your product have value in a secondary market?</p>

	<p>How could you leverage technology to educate the consumer about valuable product attributes (material choices, method of make considerations, etc.)?</p>

	<p>What products or categories in your business are ideal candidates for resale and/or service vs. ownership models?</p>

	<p>What kind of “Take Back” programs would make sense for your consumer (incentives, etc.)?</p>

	<p>How could your business model be adjusted to add value to how you receive, use, and return product?</p>

	<p>How else could your business model deliver value to your customer using principles of circularity (E.g. repair, resell, etc?)</p>

	<p>How could you develop educational and inspirational calls to action and other triggers to distribute throughout key communication channels (email, social, etc.)? What messages or prompts will your consumer connect with?</p>
